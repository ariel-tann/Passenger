# Passenger
Passenger is a C# console application for an airline company that issues boarding passes for an aircraft with 40 seats.

The application will first check if the user is an Airline Assistant or a normal passenger. It allows the user to check-in more than one person. Seating can be chosen or assigned by the airline. Once check-in is complete, it displays the boarding pass for each passenger. 

Airline assistants have more options than a normal user. They are able to view the seating list, which shows the status of each seat (available or taken).
